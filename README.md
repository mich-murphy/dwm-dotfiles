# Dotfiles
Here are my setup files for my Arch install using dwm. This is currently being used for a laptop, which explains some scripts. 

In the unix world programs are commonly configured with files in your home directory. Any file or directory name that starts with a dot/period is considered hidden, and in a default view will not be displayed - thus the name dotfiles.

## Management
I manage dotfiles with gnu stow. This allows me to keep a versioned directory of all my config files, that are virtually linked into place via a single command. This makes sharing these files among many users and computers super simple. Instructions for installation with gnu stow can be found [here](#installing)

## Installing
Requirements:
- `git`
- `stow`

Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mrhackendbacker/.dotfiles.git ~
```

Run `stow` to symlink all folders (ignoring README.md etc.)
```
stow */
```
Or `stow` individual folders e.g.
```
stow nvim
```

List of installed packages via pacman can be found [here](https://github.com/mich-murphy/ansible/blob/master/tasks/pacman.yml), a list of packages from aur can be found [here](https://github.com/mich-murphy/ansible/blob/master/tasks/aur.yml) 

## Neovim
Config was initially guided by [this repo](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch#get-healthy).

I've since made a number of changes to the config to remove any errors, and made some tweaks to plugins and keybindings.

Open nvim and enter the following:
```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste, also that python and node haven't been setup

First we'll fix copy/paste
```
sudo pacman -S xsel
```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support
```
pip install pynvim
```

- Neovim node support
```
npm i -g neovim
```
